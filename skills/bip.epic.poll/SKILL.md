# /bip.epic.poll

Lightweight mid-session update. Checks what changed on GitHub and in
active clones since last check. Use this instead of `/bip.epic` when
you already have context established.

For continuous auto-polling, use: `/loop 10m /bip.epic.poll`

## What to check

### 1. Recently merged PRs

```bash
gh pr list --search "is:pr is:merged sort:updated-desc" --limit 5 --json number,title,mergedAt
```

For each new merge: read the PR body (`gh pr view <N> --json body`),
note key results, check if it closes an issue.

### 2. Open PRs

```bash
gh pr list --json number,title,headRefName,state
```

Note any new PRs or CI status changes.

### 3. New issues

```bash
gh issue list --search "sort:created-desc" --limit 5 --json number,title,state,createdAt
```

### 4. Issue comments

Check comments on active issues (especially ones with running clones):

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments --jq '.[-1].body' | head -40
```

Look for **issue-lead comments** (prefixed with `🤖 **Issue Lead**`) —
these show worker evaluation results and may indicate workers that need
attention.

### 5. Slot status

Read `clone_root` and `local_worktrees` from `.epic-config.json`.

**Clone mode** (`local_worktrees` absent or false):
```bash
CLONE_ROOT=$(jq -r .clone_root .epic-config.json)
for name in $(jq -r '.clone_names[]' .epic-config.json); do
  [ -f "$CLONE_ROOT/$name/.epic-status.json" ] && echo "=== $name ===" && cat "$CLONE_ROOT/$name/.epic-status.json"
done
```

**Worktree mode** (`local_worktrees: true`):
```bash
CLONE_ROOT=$(jq -r .clone_root .epic-config.json)
find "$CLONE_ROOT" -maxdepth 1 -name 'issue-*' -type d | while read slot; do
  [ -f "$slot/.epic-status.json" ] && echo "=== $(basename $slot) ===" && cat "$slot/.epic-status.json"
done
```

Also check tmux: `tmux list-windows -F "#W"`

For active slots, check recent commits:
```bash
git -C <slot-path> log --oneline main..HEAD | head -5
```
In worktree mode, `<slot-path>` is `$CLONE_ROOT/issue-<N>`.

#### New status fields to display

When reading `.epic-status.json`, surface these fields in addition to
phase and summary:
- **stop_reason** — the lead's classification of why the worker stopped
- **lead_guidance** — what the lead told the worker to do next
- **scope** — the lead's restatement of the issue goal (useful for
  spotting drift)

#### Phase migration

Handle legacy phases from older status files:
- `blocked` → display as `needs-human`
- `pr-review` → display as `quality-gate`

### 6. Tmux output (if interesting)

For clones that seem to have finished or are blocked:
```bash
tmux capture-pane -t <N>-<clone-name> -p | tail -20
```

## After polling

### Focus on what matters

**Lead with unblocked issues** — issues that are ready to work on but
not assigned to any clone. This is the most actionable information.

**Surface lead evaluations** — if a clone's status shows a recent lead
evaluation (stop_reason set, lead_guidance present), mention the lead's
assessment briefly. This tells the conductor what the workers are doing
without having to read full issue comments.

**Flag needs-human and completed** — if any clone has `phase: "needs-human"`
(or legacy `blocked`) or `phase: "completed"`, highlight it prominently.
These require conductor attention. **Ring the terminal bell and send a
phone notification** so the user notices even if away:
```bash
printf '\a'
NTFY_TOPIC=$(grep ntfy_topic ~/.config/bip/config.yml | awk '{print $2}')
[ -n "$NTFY_TOPIC" ] && curl -s -H "Title: bip epic" -d "<clone> <phase> (<issue>)" "ntfy.sh/$NTFY_TOPIC" > /dev/null
```

**Only report active clones** — clones with a tmux window that are
actually doing something. Don't list completed or idle clones; that's
noise. Completed clones can be mentioned briefly ("fir completed i374")
but don't need a table row.

**Mention recent merges** only if they unblock something or change
the plan.

### Output structure

1. **Unblocked issues**: Issues ready for work, not assigned to a clone.
   Cross-reference with EPIC dashboards to find next items.

2. **Active work**: Clones with tmux windows that are mid-task. One line
   each: clone, issue, phase, stop_reason (if set), lead assessment.

3. **Needs human**: Clones in `needs-human` phase — show the lead's
   assessment and what decision is needed.

4. **Recently landed** (brief): PRs merged since last poll, only if
   noteworthy.

5. **Propose spawns**: If unblocked issues and idle clones exist, propose
   which to spawn. Wait for confirmation.

### Housekeeping (do silently, don't report unless problems)

This is the ongoing cleanup that keeps slots and EPICs current between
cold starts. Do it every poll cycle — don't wait for `/bip.epic`.

#### Slot cleanup for merged PRs

For each slot whose PR has merged (cross-reference merged PRs from
check 1 with slot branches):

**Worktree mode**:
```bash
CLONE_ROOT=$(jq -r .clone_root .epic-config.json)
# Confirm PR is merged before removing
gh pr list --head <branch> --state merged --json number | jq length
# If merged:
git worktree remove "$CLONE_ROOT/issue-<N>"
git branch -d <branch>
```

**Clone mode**:
```bash
CLONE_ROOT=$(jq -r .clone_root .epic-config.json)
git -C "$CLONE_ROOT/<clone>" checkout main
git -C "$CLONE_ROOT/<clone>" pull --ff-only origin main
rm -f "$CLONE_ROOT/<clone>/.epic-status.json" "$CLONE_ROOT/<clone>/.epic-worklog.md"
```

Also clean up stale slots: no tmux window AND `.epic-status.json`
older than 30 minutes. Same cleanup as above.

#### EPIC body updates

If merges closed issues tracked in an EPIC, update the EPIC body:
follow the **EPIC body update pattern** from `/bip.epic` (pull →
edit → conflict-check → push). Check the box for completed items,
update the clone assignments table.

#### Memory

- Update MEMORY.md only for orchestrator-level decisions/patterns

## Conventions

Same as `/bip.epic`: `iN`/`pN` prefixes, full URLs on first mention.
Tmux windows named `NNN-YYY` where NNN is the issue number and YYY is the
clone/slot name (e.g. `281-cedar` in clone mode, `281-issue-281` in worktree mode).
