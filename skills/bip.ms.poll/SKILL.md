# /bip.ms.poll

Lightweight mid-session update for a manuscript session. Checks what
changed in tracked code repos and EPICs since last check, fetches new
artifacts from remote, and reacts to new results.

For continuous auto-polling, use: `/loop 10m /bip.ms.poll`

## What to check

### 1. EPIC updates

For each repo/epic in `.ms-config.json`:

```bash
gh issue view <epic-number> --repo <org/repo> --json body,updatedAt
```

Compare `updatedAt` with last known timestamp. If changed, parse the
body for:
- Newly checked boxes (completed items)
- New key findings
- Changes to active clone assignments

### 2. Recently merged PRs

```bash
gh pr list --repo <org/repo> --search "is:merged sort:updated-desc" --limit 5 --json number,title,body,mergedAt
```

For each new merge since last poll: read the PR body, note key results,
check if it produced figures or notebooks.

### 3. Pull and selectively fetch results

For each tracked repo in `.ms-config.json`:

```bash
LOCAL_PATH=<expanded local_path>

# Git pull — picks up committed code and Makefile changes
git -C "$LOCAL_PATH" pull --ff-only origin main

# Selective fetch — run each fetch_cmd inside the local clone
cd "$LOCAL_PATH"
# e.g. make remote-fetch DIR=experiments/2026-03-benchmark/results
# e.g. make artifacts-pull DIR=figures/final
```

Only fetch directories listed in `fetch_cmds`. Remote experiment trees
can be very large — never pull everything. When the EPIC reports a new
experiment that matters for the manuscript, add its result path to
`fetch_cmds` in `.ms-config.json`.

After fetching, identify what's new:
```bash
find "$LOCAL_PATH" \( -name "*.svg" -o -name "*.html" \) -mmin -60 | head -20
```

### 4. Open PR activity

```bash
gh pr list --repo <org/repo> --json number,title,headRefName,state
```

Note any PRs approaching merge that might produce results soon.

## React to new artifacts

### New SVG figures

When new SVGs are found after a fetch:

1. Show the user what's new:
   ```
   **New SVG**: peak-origins/experiments/benchmark/results/fig3.svg (fetched just now)
   ```

2. Ask if it should be imported to `prep-figures/`:
   ```bash
   PREP_DIR=$(jq -r .prep_figures_dir .ms-config.json)
   cp "<source>" "$PREP_DIR/"
   make pdf-figures
   ```

3. If imported, check if the manuscript already references it. If not,
   suggest placement and draft the `\includegraphics` block.

### New HTML notebooks

When new `.html` notebooks are found after fetch:

```bash
open -a "Google Chrome" "<path-to-notebook.html>"
```

Tell the user what notebook was opened and which EPIC/issue produced it.
After they review, ask which plots or findings to incorporate.

### New key findings in EPICs

When an EPIC body has new findings (numbered items in the Key Findings
section that weren't there before):

1. Quote the finding
2. Read the relevant PR or experiment that produced it
3. Present the key points as a **bullet-point summary**
4. Ask the user which to include and where in the manuscript
5. After confirmation, draft the paragraph(s) in LaTeX
6. Run the `@scientific-tex-editor` agent on the new text for style review
7. Present the edited draft for final approval

### Issue creation

If during polling you notice gaps — an experiment that should be run,
a comparison that's missing, a figure variant that would strengthen
the paper — propose raising an issue on the tracked repo:

1. Describe what's needed and why (from the manuscript perspective)
2. After user confirmation, run `/issue-next` targeting the tracked repo
3. The remote EPIC conductor will pick it up on its next poll

## After polling

### Output structure

1. **New results** (lead with this): Figures, notebooks, or findings
   that arrived since last poll. One line each with source and age.

2. **Active work**: Which EPICs have active clones, brief status.
   Only mention if something changed.

3. **Approaching completion**: PRs close to merge that will produce
   results soon.

4. **Proposed actions**: Concrete list — import figure X, open
   notebook Y, draft text for finding Z, raise issue for gap W.

Ring the terminal bell and send a phone notification if a major new
result arrives (new figure or quantitative finding):
```bash
printf '\a'
NTFY_TOPIC=$(grep ntfy_topic ~/.config/bip/config.yml | awk '{print $2}')
[ -n "$NTFY_TOPIC" ] && curl -s -H "Title: bip ms" -d "New result: <description>" "ntfy.sh/$NTFY_TOPIC" > /dev/null
```

### Verify state before reporting

When mentioning any PR or issue in the poll output, always verify its
current state programmatically (`gh pr view --json state`, `gh issue
view --json state`) rather than relying on earlier poll results or
conversation memory. Stale state leads to confusing reports (e.g.,
reporting a merged PR as "open").

### Keep it brief

This is a poll, not a cold start. Only report what changed. If nothing
changed, say so in one line:

> All quiet across tracked repos. No new results since last check.

## Housekeeping (silent)

- Track `updatedAt` timestamps for EPICs to detect changes efficiently
- Track last-seen merged PR numbers to avoid re-processing
- After fetching, note which files are new vs already seen

## Conventions

Same as `/bip.ms`: `iN`/`pN` prefixes, full URLs on first mention.
