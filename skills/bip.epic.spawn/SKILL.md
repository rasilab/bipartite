# /bip.epic.spawn

Spawn a Claude Code session in a tmux window to work on a GitHub issue.
The worker runs inside a **ralph-loop** with an **issue-lead subagent**
that evaluates progress at stopping points.

## Usage

```
/bip.epic.spawn <issue-number> [clone-name]
```

If clone-name is omitted, pick the best idle clone automatically.

## Configuration

Reads `.epic-config.json` from the repo root (see `/bip.epic` for format).
**If the file does not exist**, stop and ask the user to configure it
via `/bip.epic` first.

## Workflow

### Prerequisite: Issue number required

Every spawn MUST target an existing GitHub issue. If the conductor wants
to spawn work that doesn't have an issue yet (reruns, follow-ups, quick
experiments), file the issue first:

1. Write a minimal issue body (title + 3-sentence motivation + success criteria)
2. `gh issue create --title "..." --body-file ISSUE-*.md`
3. Then proceed with the spawn using the new issue number

Never write a spawn prompt with `issue=0` or without `/work-issue <N>`.
Issueless spawns break EPIC tracking, PR linking, and conductor polling.

### Step 1: Select or create slot

Read `clone_root` and `local_worktrees` from `.epic-config.json`.

**Clone mode** (`local_worktrees` absent or false):

If clone-name not specified, find an idle clone:
```bash
CLONE_ROOT=$(jq -r .clone_root .epic-config.json)
for name in $(jq -r '.clone_names[]' .epic-config.json); do
  branch=$(git -C "$CLONE_ROOT/$name" branch --show-current 2>/dev/null)
  [ "$branch" = "main" ] && echo "$name"
done
```

Prefer clones with clean worktrees. If all busy, offer to create a new
clone using a name from `new_clone_names` in the config.

**Worktree mode** (`local_worktrees: true`):

Slot name is always `issue-<N>`. Branch name is `<N>-<slug>` where `<slug>`
is the first 4 words of the issue title, lowercased and hyphenated.

Check if slot already exists:
```bash
CLONE_ROOT=$(jq -r .clone_root .epic-config.json)
SLOT="$CLONE_ROOT/issue-<N>"
if [ -d "$SLOT" ]; then
  # Worktree exists — check for active tmux window
  if tmux list-windows -F "#W" | grep -q "^<N>-issue-<N>$"; then
    echo "Active session already running for <N>-issue-<N> — attach to it instead"
    exit 0
  else
    echo "Worktree exists, no active session — will resume"
  fi
else
  # Check for leftover branch from a previous failed attempt
  if git branch --list "<N>-*" | grep -q .; then
    git branch -D $(git branch --list "<N>-*" | tr -d ' ')
  fi
  # Create worktree from the main repo (conductor's working directory)
  git worktree add "$SLOT" -b <N>-<slug>
fi
```

### Step 2: Prepare slot and clean stale state

**Clone mode**:
```bash
CLONE_ROOT=$(jq -r .clone_root .epic-config.json)
cd "$CLONE_ROOT/<clone>"
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only origin main
rm -f .epic-status.json .epic-worklog.md
```

**Worktree mode**: worktree was just created fresh from main — just clear
any stale status files from a previous run on this same issue:
```bash
rm -f "$SLOT/.epic-status.json" "$SLOT/.epic-worklog.md"
```

**State cleanup is mandatory** — stale files from a previous assignment
will confuse the worker and lead.

### Step 3: Read the issue

```bash
gh issue view <number> --json title,body
```

Extract key context: what the issue asks for, data locations, phasing,
dependencies.

### Step 4: Compose the prompt

The prompt has two parts: (1) the work instructions passed as the
initial message to `claude` via `--prompt-file`, and (2) a ralph-loop
invocation that the worker runs as its first action. The ralph-loop
prompt is kept SHORT (no special characters) — just a reminder to
continue. The detailed instructions are already in the conversation
from the initial message.

**Prompt file** (written by conductor to /tmp/spawn-N.txt):
```
You are working on GitHub issue #N TITLE.

First, run this command to start the iteration loop:
/ralph-loop:ralph-loop --completion-promise 'ISSUE WORK COMPLETE' --max-iterations 20 Continue working on the task. Read .epic-status.json and .epic-worklog.md for context. Output ISSUE WORK COMPLETE in promise tags when done.

EPIC STATUS PROTOCOL — You MUST follow this:
1. At session start, write .epic-status.json (see format below)
2. Update it when you transition between phases
3. Update it when you finish or encounter a blocker
4. Maintain .epic-worklog.md as a narrative log (see format below)

.epic-status.json fields:
  issue — the issue number
  title — short title
  phase — one of: exploring, coding, testing, awaiting-results, quality-gate, needs-human, completed
  summary — human-readable one-liner
  updated_at — ISO 8601 timestamp
  blockers — list of blockers (empty list if none)
  scope — one-line restatement of issue goal (set by lead)
  stop_reason — category from lead decision framework (set by lead)
  lead_guidance — what the lead told you to do next (set by lead)
  lead_notes — list of lead evaluation entries (set by lead)
  awaiting — set when waiting for experiment results (description, check_cmd, check_files, started_at, timeout_hours)

.epic-worklog.md format (append-only, never edit previous entries):
Timestamped markdown entries with phase header.
Brief description of what you did and why (3-5 sentences per entry).

RECOVERING CONTEXT (after compaction):
1. Read .epic-status.json — current phase and lead guidance
2. Read .epic-worklog.md — narrative of what happened
3. If lead_guidance is set → follow it
4. If lead_guidance is empty → read the last worklog entry and continue
5. If both are empty → read the issue and begin fresh

BRANCH: Create branch N-short-name from main.
AUTONOMY: Do the work. Do not ask the user whether to proceed with
implementation steps, run experiments, or set up tests — just do them.

EXPERIMENTS ARE MANDATORY: If the issue specifies running an experiment,
benchmark, or analysis, you MUST run it before considering the work done.
Writing code is not enough — the issue is not complete until every
experiment described in it has been executed and results collected.
Do not stop at "code is ready to run" — actually run it.

WORKLOG: Append entries to .epic-worklog.md when:
- Starting work or reading the issue
- Changing approach or strategy
- Hitting a blocker
- Completing a phase
- Receiving lead guidance (copy it to the worklog)

AWAITING RESULTS:
If you launch a long-running experiment:
1. Set phase to awaiting-results in .epic-status.json
2. Set the awaiting field with check_cmd and check_files
3. Each ralph-loop iteration: run check_cmd, if not ready end the turn
4. After 3 consecutive check failures, set stop_reason to
   mechanical-blocker and invoke the lead

STOPPING POINTS — When you reach a natural stopping point:
1. Append a worklog entry describing what you did and why you stopped
2. Update .epic-status.json with phase, summary, stop_reason
3. Spawn the issue-lead subagent for evaluation:

   Use the Agent tool with subagent_type issue-lead and prompt:
   Evaluate progress on issue #N in this clone. Follow your
   full evaluation protocol: read .epic-status.json,
   .epic-worklog.md, the issue body, commits, PR, and any
   experiment results. Write your assessment and guidance.

4. Read the lead response:
   - If it says PHASE: completed or PHASE: needs-human →
     output the completion promise ISSUE WORK COMPLETE
   - Otherwise → copy the lead guidance to .epic-worklog.md
     as a Lead guidance entry, then continue working

COMPLETION: When done (or when lead says completed):
1. Commit all work and push the branch
2. Create a PR with gh pr create, title matches issue, body says Closes #N
3. Update .epic-status.json phase to quality-gate
4. QUALITY GATE LOOP — repeat until both pass clean:
   a. Run /pr-check — fix everything it flags, commit and push
   b. Run /pr-review — fix ALL issues (even minor/advisory), commit and push
   c. If either flagged issues, go back to (a)
   Track quality gate iterations in .epic-status.json
5. When both pass with zero issues:
   - Invoke the issue-lead one final time (it will set phase to completed)
   - Output the completion promise ISSUE WORK COMPLETE
6. STOP only if a finding requires genuine user judgment (design
   questions, ambiguous requirements, architectural tradeoffs).
   For everything else — formatting, test gaps, docs, naming,
   lint, cruft — just fix it and move on.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
(Add issue-specific context here — data locations, phasing
instructions, remote execution notes, dependencies, key files)

Now read the issue and begin work:
/work-issue N
```

### Common context additions

**Filesystem mode** — always include this block when the issue involves running jobs on remote compute nodes. Check `shared_filesystem` in `.epic-config.json`:

*When `shared_filesystem: false` (laptop — files must be synced):*
```
- Use make remote-sync + make remote-tmux for running on remote servers
- Use /bip.scout to find an available server before remote operations
- Always rebuild after sync: make remote-tmux REMOTE_HOST=... CMD='zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast'
- Wrap the experiment in a Snakemake workflow
```

*When `shared_filesystem: true` (NFS — files already visible on all nodes):*
```
- Use /bip.scout to find an available server before remote operations
- For short/medium jobs (< ~30 min): block on SSH
    ssh <host> "cd <absolute_clone_path> && <command>"
  Results appear on NFS immediately — no sync or polling needed.
- For long jobs (hours): background the SSH call, then poll local NFS paths
    ssh <host> "cd <absolute_clone_path> && nohup <command> > out.log 2>&1 &"
  Use the awaiting-results phase with check_files pointing to local NFS
  output paths — no SSH needed to poll, just test -f /nfs/path/output.
- Never use make remote-sync or make remote-tmux in NFS mode.
- SSH quoting tip: if a command has complex quoting or special characters,
  write it to a temp file (e.g. /tmp/run-<N>.sh), then:
    ssh <host> "bash /nfs/path/to/run-<N>.sh"
  Clean up the temp file when the command finishes.
- Use the absolute clone path in SSH commands (expand ~ from clone_root
  before embedding — remote shells resolve ~ relative to the SSH user's
  home, which may differ from the NFS path).
```

**For experiments (Snakemake workflows):**
```
- SSF143587 data is at ~/re/superfamily-pcp/results/SSF143587/
- Wrap the experiment in a Snakemake workflow
```

**For code changes:**
```
- Run zig build test before committing
- Run make parity if touching shared alignment code
- Check PRE-MERGE-CHECKLIST.md
```

**For phased work:**
```
- This issue has multiple phases. Start with Phase 1 only.
- Phase 1: <describe scope and gate criteria>
- Only proceed to Phase 2 if the gate passes.
```

### Step 5: Launch tmux window

Write the composed prompt to a temp file, then use `bip spawn` with
`--prompt-file` to pass it. This avoids shell expansion issues with
quotes, braces, and special characters in the prompt.

```bash
CLONE_ROOT=$(jq -r .clone_root .epic-config.json)

# Write prompt to temp file (conductor does this, NOT via shell expansion)
# Use the Write tool to create /tmp/spawn-<N>.txt with the full prompt

# Clone mode: --name is NNN-clone (e.g. "281-cedar")
bip spawn --prompt-file /tmp/spawn-<N>.txt \
  --dir "$CLONE_ROOT/<clone-name>" \
  --name "<N>-<clone-name>"

# Worktree mode: --name is NNN-issue-NNN (e.g. "281-issue-281")
bip spawn --prompt-file /tmp/spawn-<N>.txt \
  --dir "$CLONE_ROOT/issue-<N>" \
  --name "<N>-issue-<N>"
```

**IMPORTANT**: Always use `--prompt-file`, never `--prompt "$(cat file)"`.
The `$(cat)` pattern causes zsh shell expansion errors with complex prompts.

**Do NOT** use raw `tmux new-window` / `tmux send-keys` / `claude` commands.
Always go through `bip spawn` which handles the full lifecycle correctly.

### Step 6: Confirm

Report to the user:
- Which clone was spawned
- Which issue it's working on
- Any phasing or gate criteria

## Creating new slots

**Clone mode** — create a new clone and register it:
```bash
CLONE_ROOT=$(jq -r .clone_root .epic-config.json)
REPO=$(jq -r .github_repo .epic-config.json)
cd "$CLONE_ROOT"
git clone "git@github.com:$REPO.git" <new-name>
```
After creating, add the new name to `clone_names` in `.epic-config.json`.

**Worktree mode** — no registration needed; worktrees are created on demand
in Step 1 and named `issue-<N>`. No config changes required.

## Cleaning up slots after work

**Clone mode** — if a clone is on a non-main branch:
1. Check if there's an open PR: `gh pr list --head <branch>`
2. If merged/closed: `git checkout main && git pull --ff-only`
3. If open: warn user — they may want to resume

**Worktree mode** — when an issue's PR is merged:
```bash
CLONE_ROOT=$(jq -r .clone_root .epic-config.json)
git worktree remove "$CLONE_ROOT/issue-<N>"
git branch -d <N>-short-desc
```
If the worktree has uncommitted changes, use `--force`. Check for an open
PR first — don't remove a worktree with unmerged work.

## Gitignore reminder

Target project repos should gitignore these files (add to `.gitignore`):
```
.epic-status.json
.epic-worklog.md
```

These files live in clones, not in bipartite itself.

## Conventions

Same as `/bip.epic`: `iN`/`pN` prefixes. Tmux windows named `NNN-YYY`
where NNN is the issue number and YYY is the clone/slot name
(e.g. `281-cedar` in clone mode, `281-issue-281` in worktree mode).
