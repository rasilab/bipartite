# /pre-merge-check

Run a comprehensive quality checklist before merging a PR. Automatically detects project type and runs appropriate checks.

## Usage

```
/pre-merge-check
```

## Workflow

### Step 0: Check for Project-Specific Checklist

First, check for a project-specific checklist:
1. Look for `PRE-MERGE-CHECKLIST.md` in the repo root
2. If not found, read the project's `CLAUDE.md` and look for a "Pre-PR Quality Checklist" or "Pre-Merge Checklist" section

**If a project-specific checklist is found, follow those steps exactly** instead of the generic workflow below.

### Step 1: Detect Project Type

Examine the repository to determine what checks apply:

| Indicator | Project Type | Agents to Use |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| `workflow/*.smk` or `Snakefile` | Snakemake pipeline | `snakemake-pipeline-expert` |
| `*.py` files in `src/` or project root | Python project | `clean-code-reviewer` |
| `build.zig` or `*.zig` files in `src/` | Zig project | `zig-code-reviewer` |
| `go.mod` | Go project | `clean-code-reviewer` |
| `package.json` | Node.js project | `clean-code-reviewer` |

Multiple types can apply (e.g., Snakemake + Python).

### Step 1.5: Fetch and determine base branch

Always fetch first so comparisons are against the true remote state, not a stale local branch:

```bash
git fetch origin
```

Determine the base branch from the PR (if one exists), otherwise default to `main` or `master`:

```bash
gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName 2>/dev/null || echo "main"
```

Use `origin/<base>` (not local `<base>`) for all diffs below. This avoids false positives from a stale local main.

### Step 2: Identify Changed Files

```bash
git diff origin/<base>...HEAD --name-only
```

Focus review on changed files, not the entire codebase.

### Step 3: Check for Large Files and Cruft

Scan changed files for artifacts that typically shouldn't be committed:

**Suspicious file types** (flag for user review):
- HTML files from notebook execution (`.html` in output directories)
- Image files (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.svg`, `.pdf`) unless in expected locations like `docs/` or `assets/`
- Binary files and archives (`.zip`, `.tar`, `.gz`, `.pkl`, `.pickle`, `.npy`, `.npz`)
- Large data files (`.csv`, `.tsv`, `.parquet`) over 100KB
- Cache/build artifacts (`__pycache__/`, `.pyc`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`)

**Acceptable** (don't flag):
- Small JSON result files (< 100KB)
- Config files (`.json`, `.yml`, `.yaml` in root or config directories)
- Test fixtures in `testdata/` or `tests/fixtures/`

**Check file sizes:**
```bash
git diff origin/<base>...HEAD --name-only | xargs -I{} sh -c 'test -f "{}" && stat -f "%z %N" "{}" 2>/dev/null || stat --format="%s %n" "{}" 2>/dev/null' | awk '$1 > 102400 {print}'
```

Flag anything suspicious for user confirmation before proceeding.

### Step 4: Run Agent Reviews (in parallel when possible)

**For Snakemake projects:**
- Launch `snakemake-pipeline-expert` agent to review workflow structure, rule organization, and best practices

**For all projects with code changes:**
- Launch `clean-code-reviewer` agent on modified source files (not tests)

### Step 5: Run Automated Checks

Detect and run available quality tools:

| Tool Indicator | Check to Run |
|----------------|--------------|
| `pixi.toml` | Use `pixi run` prefix |
| `pyproject.toml` with ruff | `ruff check .` |
| `Makefile` with `check` target | `make check` |
| `build.zig` | `zig build test` and `zig fmt --check src/ tests/` |
| `go.mod` | `go test ./...` and `go vet ./...` |
| `Snakefile` | `snakemake --lint` |
| `tests/` directory | `pytest` (or project-specific test command) |

### Step 6: Test Audit

Run a thorough test quality review using an agent. Grepping alone is insufficient—tests need semantic analysis to detect:

- Placeholder tests (empty bodies, just `pass`, meaningless assertions)
- Inappropriate use of mocks (if project forbids mocking)
- Tests that don't actually test anything (`assert True`, trivial assertions)
- Tests with `pytest.skip` that should have real implementations
- Tests that silently catch exceptions instead of letting them propagate

**Launch a `clean-code-reviewer` agent specifically for test files:**

```
Review the test files in tests/ for test quality issues:
1. Placeholder tests (empty or pass-only test bodies)
2. Mock usage (if project constitution forbids mocks)
3. Trivial assertions (assert True, assert 1==1)
4. Unconditional pytest.skip() that should be real tests
5. Tests that catch and swallow exceptions
6. Tests without meaningful assertions

Focus on tests for changed code. Report specific file:line references.
```

Report findings with severity (blocking vs advisory).

### Step 7: Mathematical Documentation (for mathematical PRs)

**Skip this step** if the PR doesn't involve mathematical/statistical computation.

**Detect mathematical PR**: Check if the changed source files contain:
- Mathematical formulas in docstrings (Greek letters, summations, matrix notation)
- Scientific computation (matrix operations, probability distributions, statistical models)
- Algorithm implementations with mathematical foundations

**If mathematical**, check the PR for an existing mathematical specification comment:

1. **Check for existing math comment on the PR**: Use `gh pr view` and look for comments containing LaTeX code blocks or mathematical notation

2. **If no math comment exists**:
   - Back-translate the implementation directly into mathematical notation
   - Use LaTeX code blocks for formulas
   - Document the actual computation, not perceived intent
   - Post as a comment on the PR with 🤖 prefix
   - Include in report: "Posted mathematical specification to PR"

3. **If math comment already exists**:
   - Re-read the implementation carefully
   - Compare against the existing mathematical specification
   - Check for discrepancies (formula errors, missing steps, outdated notation)
   - If discrepancies found: post a correction comment and flag in report
   - If accurate: note "Mathematical specification verified" in report

4. **Literature verification for pre-existing formulas**:
   - If the implementation uses formulas from established literature (standard models, known algorithms, published methods), verify against the source paper
   - **Search local bip library first**: `bip search "method name"` or `bip search -a "Author"`
   - The reference paper should already be in our library; if not found locally, ask user before searching externally
   - Use pdf-navigator tools to read the actual paper and verify the implementation matches the published definition
   - Include the bip paper ID in the math comment to demonstrate correctness
   - Flag any discrepancies between implementation and literature as blocking issues

**Mathematical comment format**:
```markdown
🤖 Mathematical specification back-translated from the implementation in PR #XXX:

## [Section Name]

[Description of what this computes]

```latex
[Formula in LaTeX]
```

[Continue for each major mathematical component...]
```

### Step 8: Generate Report

Present a checklist summary:

```markdown
## Pre-Merge Quality Report

### Agent Reviews
- [ ] Snakemake review: [findings or ✓]
- [ ] Code review: [findings or ✓]

### Large Files / Cruft
- [x] No suspicious files found
- [ ] ⚠️ Flagged for review: `output/results.html` (notebook output?)

### Automated Checks
- [x] Linting: passed
- [x] Tests: 124 passed
- [ ] Format: 2 files need formatting

### Test Audit
- [x] No placeholder tests found
- [x] No forbidden mocks found

### Mathematical Documentation (if applicable)
- [x] Mathematical specification posted to PR
- [x] Existing specification verified against implementation
- [x] Literature references provided for pre-existing formulas

### Action Items
1. Fix formatting in `src/foo.py`
2. Address code review suggestion about X
```

## Error Handling

- **Not on a branch**: Warn that this should be run from a feature branch
- **No changes from main**: Note that branch appears to be up-to-date with main
- **Missing tools**: Skip checks for tools not installed, note in report
- **Agent failures**: Report the failure but continue with other checks

## Notes

- This skill coordinates multiple agents and tools; it may take a few minutes
- Agent reviews focus on changed files to keep feedback relevant
- The skill adapts to each project's tooling automatically
